# OpenSource-uTube
### YouTube, but it's open source, and Google monetisation free
**this version is in ruski**


## How it works:

- Open the site
- The site masks YouTube's site.
- Whenever someone wants to watch an video, it gets live feedback from YouTube's servers, and this is how I setup. (this may cause issues, such as excessive buffering, but I couldn't figure any other way)


If you want to fork this repo, feel free, it's Open Source!
